# Youtube desktop app with multimedia keyboard shortcuts

Do you want to be able to listen to Youtube playlists without switching to your browser tab?
Want to skip a song with your keyboard shortcuts?

I do, and Iâ€™ve created an electron wrapper to help me with this problem.

Built with a great deal of help from https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier


## Installation

With [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed,

```bash
npm install nativefier -g
cd /Applications
git clone https://github.com/burtontanner/youtube-keyboard-shortcuts 
nativefier http://music.youtube.com --inject youtube-keyboard-shortcuts/index.js --overwrite
rm -rf youtube-keyboard-shortcuts 

```
where `index.js` is the file you you will find on this repo.


After this all you need to do is login and enjoy listening to your cool youtube playlists as I do
